# awesome-travel

A list of useful tools (digital, electronic, offline, etc.) for your next
travel.

## Planning

* **[Wikitravel][1]** - completely crowd-sourced travel guide. Opinions of
  thousands of writers makes each travel guide really interesting, holistic and
  not unnecessarily romanticised like travel books. Gives practical
  advices.
* **[Moon Guides][2]** - like Lonely Planet, but better. Simple to get started
  about a place - does not overload you with a lot of information. Very
  practical.
* **[Rough Guides][3]** - like Lonely Planet, but better. Very detailed about
  the places they cover. Also, they come with pre-built itineraries about
  important places to cover that can help you plan your own itinerary.
  Itineraries can also be found on their websites for free. It's a handy
  resource while traveling to find more details about a place.
* **Tripadvisor[4]** - for reviews of restaurants, hotels, BnBs, shops,
  experiences. Also, a really good forum to ask questions from others people
  to plan your next trip. Most probably your questions have already been asked
  which means that the answers you are looking for are just a Google search
  away.
* **Google Trips** - detects your next travel from Gmail to suggest itineraries
  withing a city. It can also auto-magically create day trips suggesting where
  to start and what route to take for covering places you want to see. Also
  syncs with Google Maps so places you bookmark here are shown on Google Maps.
* **[Airbnb Experiences][7]** - for finding and booking activities and
  experiences.
* **[Nomad List][5]** - for [digital nomads][6] to find their next destination
  travel or live and work. Also, good for travellers looking to find interesting
  facts about their next destination, either for planning or just for fun.

## Navigation

* **[Google Maps][1]** - the de-facto of navigation. It's amazing how much
  Google Maps has covered. Always good to check your next destination before you
  start to find most accurate directions.
* **[Waze][2]** - Although Google Maps should mostly work everwhere, sometimes
  the features could be different in different countries. For example, the
  driving navigation feature didn't work me when I was in Morocco. In situations
  like such, Waze is a great alternative. Also, additional features like speed 
  trap, gas stations, restaurants, tourist information centers, etc. an come in
  handy.
* **[City Mapper][3]** - transport app (bus, subway routes and timings) for
  Europe. Works only in a few cities though but it is used a lot more than
  Google Maps by the locals.
