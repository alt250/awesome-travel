travel.

## Planning

* **Rough Guides** - 
* **Tripadvisor** - 
* **Google Trips** - detects your next travel from Gmail to suggest itineraries
  withing a city. It can also auto-magically create day trips suggesting where
  to start and what route to take for covering places you want to see. Also
  syncs with Google Maps so places you bookmark here are shown on Google Maps.

## Navigation

* **[Google Maps][1]** - the de-facto of navigation. It's amazing how much
  Google Maps has covered. Always good to check your next destination before you
  start to find most accurate directions.
* **[Waze][2]** - Although Google Maps should mostly work everwhere, sometimes
  the features could be different in different countries. For example, the
  driving navigation feature didn't work me when I was in Morocco. In situations
  like such, Waze is a great alternative. Also, additional features like speed 
  trap, gas stations, restaurants, tourist information centers, etc. an come in
  handy.
* **[City Mapper][3]** - transport app (bus, subway routes and timings) for
  Europe. Works only in a few cities though but it is used a lot more than
  Google Maps by the locals.
